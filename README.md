# Shopping Cart Project
I researched in the Robotics, Automation, and Mechatronics lab at Rutgers University from Summer 2020 to 2021. 

With the support from my mentor and partners, they assisted me in making my idea come to life! We created a human-following autonomous shopping cart and published our research findings in a little under a year! 

<b>OPTIMAL TRAJECTORIES FOR AUTONOMOUS HUMAN FOLLOWING CARTS</b>

<i>(co-authored paper + was accepted into ACC 2021)</i>
* Conducted research on autonomous systems with Dr. Jingang Yi to develop a framework that produces optimal trajectories for contactless carts to achieve safe shopping in crowded environments
* Utilized RGB cameras for human tracking and activity recognition and Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) to estimate robot poses and calculate optimal trajectories
* Experimented through ROS/Gazebo simulations using modified Turtlebot3 platforms and in-lab experiments with an omni-directional robot to prove the accuracy and robustness of technology
* Prototyped autonomous shopping cart and prepare for onsite testing with human subjects
