# Shopping Cart

I have researched in the Robotics, Automation, and Mechatronics lab at Rutgers University from Summer 2020 to 2021 and with the support from my mentor and partners, developed a human-following autonomous shopping cart for safe shopping in crowded environments. 

More information regarding the project can be found [here][1]. 

This folder contains all of the code for my Shopping Cart research project.
